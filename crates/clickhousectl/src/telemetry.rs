//! Anonymous usage telemetry (issue #283).
//!
//! Consent model follows Homebrew: nothing is ever sent before the first-run
//! notice has been shown — unless the user explicitly runs
//! `clickhousectl telemetry enable`, which is itself consent (stronger than
//! passively seeing a notice) and skips the notice. State lives in
//! `~/.clickhouse/telemetry.json`
//! (`{"disabled": false}`), which doubles as the first-run marker — the notice
//! is only printed after the file has been written successfully, so an
//! unwritable config dir fails open to disabled (no send, no error, no
//! repeated notice). `DO_NOT_TRACK` (donottrack.sh convention) overrides
//! everything: no notice, no file write, no send.
//!
//! The payload carries the command path plus flag and positional *names* only
//! — never any values. It is built from the clap definitions ([`capture`] walks
//! `ArgMatches` ids and `Arg` metadata, never touching `get_one`/`get_raw`), so
//! leaking a value is structurally impossible. Positional *presence* is
//! recorded as the definition-owned id (#480), which is what makes
//! `local server stop` and `local server stop <name>` distinguishable; see
//! [`Payload::positionals`] for the exclusions.
//!
//! Every invocation of the binary goes through the same consent state machine
//! (#320). Bare, `--help`, `--version`, and mistyped commands show the first-run
//! notice. A structured local failure defers a still-pending notice so stderr
//! remains one JSON value; a later human-readable invocation shows it. Failed
//! invocations are exactly the signal that shows where the CLI confuses people
//! and agents. A successful parse is captured exactly from `ArgMatches`; a
//! failed parse has none, so [`capture_lossy`] re-walks argv against the
//! clap definitions and records the longest *valid* prefix, the error kind,
//! and clap's suggestion re-anchored to a definition string — the unmatched
//! token itself never leaves the machine.
//!
//! Two commands hand the process over to another program via `exec()`
//! (`local client`, host `psql`), replacing the process image so `main`'s
//! tail never runs on success. Those call sites invoke
//! [`finalize_before_exec`] immediately before `exec()`; it records the
//! stashed invocation with outcome `"exec_attempt"` and shares an
//! exactly-once guard with [`finalize`] so a *failed* `exec()` — where the
//! error propagates back to `main` — never produces a second event.
//!
//! `"exec_attempt"` is a **censored** outcome (#471): it proves the handoff
//! hook was reached, never that the process image was replaced and never
//! anything about the handed-over program's status. The handoff call sites
//! therefore validate what can be validated *before* the hook runs (the
//! selected binary is a regular file with an execute bit; `psql` is on
//! `PATH`), so the deterministic launch failures are ordinary
//! `"error"`/exit-1 events. What is left — a binary unlinked or chmod-ed
//! between validation and `exec()`, a bad executable format — is a race no
//! pre-flight can close, and it lands on `"exec_attempt"` with the correct
//! exit code and message still reaching the shell.
//!
//! A failed *runtime* invocation can also carry a bounded description of how
//! it failed (#450): `failure_stage`, `failure_kind`, an allowlisted
//! `http_status`, and retry/provisioning/duration buckets, all of them closed
//! vocabularies owned by [`crate::failure`] and recorded only at code-owned
//! error boundaries. The values are `&'static str`s from the definitions and
//! an allowlisted number, so — like every other field here — they cannot
//! carry a value the user typed or the API returned. See [`Payload`] for the
//! omission rules.
//!
//! Transport is a detached child process (`clickhousectl telemetry send`,
//! hidden): the parent spawns it with all stdio nulled and never waits, so
//! command latency is unaffected even when the endpoint is unreachable. The
//! child fires one POST with a short timeout and dies silently on any failure.
