//! Privacy-safe runtime failure classification (#450).
//!
//! Fork note: the cloud-side classifiers and recorders were removed with the
//! cloud stack; only the snapshot surface below still serves the optional
//! `telemetry` feature. The unused vocabulary and machinery are kept (rather
//! than pruned piecemeal) because the whole module sits on the removal list
//! together with `telemetry` itself.
#![allow(dead_code)]

//!
//! Anonymous telemetry used to describe every non-auth runtime failure of
//! `cloud service query` as `outcome=error, exit_code=1`, which made 6,444
//! exit-1 events indistinguishable: a syntax error, a stopped service, a
//! rate-limited provisioning burst and a broken pipe all looked the same.
//! This module adds the missing axes as **closed, definition-owned
//! categories**:
//!
//! * [`FailureStage`] — which stage of the run failed;
//! * [`FailureKind`] — what kind of failure it was;
//! * a bounded HTTP status ([`bounded_status`]);
//! * a retry-count bucket, the query-credential [`ProvisioningState`], and a
//!   duration bucket.
//!
//! # The privacy boundary
//!
//! Every category is a Rust enum defined here; every serialized value is a
//! `&'static str` returned by an `as_str` method or a `u16` that survived the
//! [`REPORTABLE_STATUSES`] allowlist. Nothing in the recorded state can hold
//! an owned `String`, so SQL text, identifiers, file paths, response bodies
//! and credentials are *structurally* unable to reach the payload — the same
//! guarantee `telemetry::capture` gives for flag names, enforced by the types
//! rather than by scrubbing.
//!
//! Categories are set **only at code-owned error boundaries**: a
//! [`FailureKind`] comes from matching the library's typed error variant
//! ([`classify_api_error`]) or from the CLI operation that failed, never from
//! parsing an error message, and a [`FailureStage`] is supplied by the call
//! site that owns the stage. [`State::record`] is first-write-wins so the
//! innermost boundary — the one that actually knows what happened — survives
//! a coarser fallback recorded by an outer wrapper.
//!
//! The recorders are compiled unconditionally so call sites in the cloud
//! command modules need no `cfg` noise; without the `telemetry` feature
//! nothing reads the state back.
